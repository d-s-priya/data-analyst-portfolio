## 🛠️ Skills Applied
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- SQL (optional)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **File Used**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

---

## 📌 Key Steps
1. **Import and clean data**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
3. **Visualize churn distribution**
4. **Identify patterns based on tenure, contract type, and charges**
5. **(Optional)** Build churn prediction model using:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
