# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

## 🔍 Project Objective
Analyze customer behavior and identify key factors that influence churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Predict churn using machine learning models.

---

## 🛠️ Skills Applied
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **File Used**: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`

---

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed missing values and converted data types  
2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**:
   - Checked churn distribution by contract type, tenure, and charges
   - Visualized trends and correlations
3. **Feature Encoding**: Converted categorical columns using LabelEncoder  
4. **Modeling**:
   - Logistic Regression (Accuracy: ~80%)
   - Decision Tree (Accuracy: ~78%)
5. **Evaluation**: Used confusion matrix and classification report

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- 📉 **Month-to-month contracts** had significantly higher churn.
- 💰 Customers with **high monthly charges** were more likely to churn.
- 🕐 Customers with **low tenure** (new customers) churned more often.
- 🔐 Customers without **online security or tech support** had higher churn rates.
